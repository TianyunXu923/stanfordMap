# stanfordMap
It has following functions:
* The map is enclosed within a map frame (as shown below).
* Allow the user to click and drag on the map to change the map area which is currently visible within the map frame.
* When the user double-clicks on the map, it moves the point double-clicked to the center of the view area.
* The map frame resizes as the window is resized. As the window is enlarged, the map area will enlarge, as the window size is reduced, the map area will be reduced. The map frame maintains fixed margins on all sides. These margins are maintained as the window is resized. 
* The map supports zooming in and out. As the map zooms, the point in the center of the view area stays fixed. 
* Provide controls to scroll left, right, up, and down. Left or right scrolling causes the window to scroll 1/2 of the total width currently visible. Scrolling up or down causes the window to scroll 1/2 of the total height currently visible.
* If the user scrolls off the edges of the map, itâ€™s okay to go ahead and keep scrolling even if it means you can no longer see the map.
